                            My name is Chen Li. I am a first-generation immigrant from China. I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province. 
                            And I came to Utah when I was eight years old. I graduated from the University of Utah in 2009 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineer, 
                            and met my wife the following year in a study abroad in Japan. Since then, I have accumulated 5 years of experiences working in QA data analysis and SAP QA 
                            module sysadmin positions.
